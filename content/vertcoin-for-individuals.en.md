# Mobile payments made easy


Paying with Vertcoin is a piece of cake. It’s a two step scan and pay. You can literally forget about PINs, sign-up and tapping a card. To receive Vertcoin payments, just display the QR code in your Vertcoin wallet app and let your buddy scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).



# You're in control


As one of the most mature coins on the market (since 2014) Vertcoin transactions are extremely secure (we’re talking military grade cryptography). Your money is safe because you have all the control. You’ve got the power to authorise a payment and no one can make a payment on your behalf. As long as you protect your wallet’s login details, Vertcoin gives you complete control over your money and a strong level of protection against multiple types of fraud.



# Always on, everywhere


We’ve been on since 2014 and guess what, we’re here to stay. With a dedicated worldwide community of full nodes, we have one of the most extensive networks in the world.  
Send and receive money on any platform that accepts Vertcoin because they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Vertcoin network is always on and ready!



# A world without borders


Borders are so 1990s! Sending Vertcoin overseas or locally is exactly the same on our network. We believe that borders are so 1990s. We’ve removed the middlemen so there is no waiting, no extra fees for international transfers and no maximum amounts. 




# Make fees your b!tch


There is no fee to receive Vertcoins. And if you’re making payments, you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it’s possible to send 1,000,000 Vertcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 Vertcoin (true story). 


# Privacy because–internet 


With Vertcoin we’ve taken privacy to the next level, it’s possible to send a payment without revealing your identity. Reach out to our active community on Discord and we’ll recommend the best approach to securing your privacy.
