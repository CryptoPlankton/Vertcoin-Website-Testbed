Vertcoin did not have an ICO or Premine, as taking a large portion of a potential global currency is practically fraud.  We're constantly looking for more people to help out and build Vertcoin. Below we have listed some ways that you can help out the Vertcoin Community, whether that be accepting Vertcoin as a business or develop code for next-generation applications, everyone can help out.

# Add Vertcoin as Payment
If you are a store owner, you can <a href="../accept-vertcoin/">accept VTC</a> in your store and help adoption of our currency.
# Donate
You can <a href="../donate/">donate</a> VTC to one of our donation goals and help us with funds we can put to use towards Vertcoin's future.
# Translate Content
If you are native speaker of a language that our new website is not (yet) translated in you can help us by translating it to your native language and make our website reach out to your native audience. Talk to us on <a href="https://discord.gg/vertcoin" target="_blank">Discord</a> and we can set you up with the relevant materials to get started.
# Run a Full Node
Improve our networkâ€™s resilience. If you have a spare computer or RaspberryPi lying around, run a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vertcoin/comments/817vg6/thank_you_for_running_your_own_full_vertcoin_node/" target="_blank">full node</a>. A full node is a hosted copy of the Vertcoin blockchain, the more places the blockchain is hosted the more protected the Vertcoin becomes.
# Branding Materials
If you want to use the Vertcoin logo on your website, here's the official branding pack with vector icons and png mix all ready for use.

# Programming (Dev Team)
If you're capable of programming in either C++, Go, VB.Net, NodeJS, or Android (Java) / iOS (Obj-C / Swift) you can contribute to any of our repositories. Our new website will soon have an extensive list of the projects that are important to Vertcoin's success. Most of these projects are located on the <a href="https://github.com/vertcoin-project" target="_blank">Vertcoin Github</a>, but some are also part of the <a href="https://github.com/mit-dci" target="_blank">MIT-DCI</a> - but since they're open source you're free to contribute there too and aid our chance at a successful future. Come talk to us on <a href="https://discord.gg/vertcoin" target="_blank">Discord</a> or send a pull request on Github, we work in a similar fashion to Bitcoin Development.



# Graphic Design
If you're handy with graphics/photoshop/web design you can reach out to our marketing team on <a href="https://discord.gg/vertcoin" target="_blank">Discord</a> and they can use your help with all sorts of marketing materials. We can always use an extra set of hands. Not necessarily as a marketing team member, but for one-off design assignments they can always use help.


> tldr: We'd love help from any angle, we're very much like Bitcoin anyone can contribute their skills
