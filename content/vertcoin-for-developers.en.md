If you are a store owner, you can <a href="/accept-vertcoin/">accept</a> VTC in your store and help adoption of our currency. You can add yourself to this list by visiting us on <a href="https://discord.gg/vertcoin" target="blank">discord</a> or on the Vertcoin <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vertcoin/" target="blank">subreddit</a>.

# Plug and pay

Accepting Vertcoin is as simple as sending one. The setup is simple and can work across wide range of clients and can be especially suitable for transparent donations and tips. If you would like to implement automatic invoices, keep an eye out for the merchant implementation of LITBox which is coming soon.  


# Third Party APIs

It’s easy to find payment processing services that provide APIs; you don’t need to store Vertcoins on your server and handle the security that this implies. Most APIs allow you to process invoices and exchange your Vertcoins into your local currency at competitive costs.


# Literally be your own bank

Get the best of all worlds and run a full node. Integrate a Vertcoin node directly into your applications, allowing you to become your own bank and payment processor like a goddamn boss. With all the responsibilities that this implies, you can build amazing systems that process Vertcoin transactions however you would like (mic drop).


# Follow the chain

Vertcoin creates a unique address for each transaction. So if you were to build a payment system associated with an invoice, you simply need to generate and monitor a Vertcoin address for each payment. Never use the same address for more than one transaction.


# Client Side Security

Most security is handled by the protocol, eliminating the need for PCI compliance. Fraud prevention can be simplified down to monitoring a single variable: the confirmation score. 
Beyond that, keeping your Vertcoins secure is mainly a matter of securing your wallet and using HTTPS or other secure protocols to send payment requests to customers.


# Inspired by possibilities

Vertcoin removes financial limitations and allows you to design new and creative online services that couldn’t exist. Imagine tipping systems, automated payment solutions, distributed crowd-funding services, time locked payment management, public asset tracking, low-trust escrow services, micro-payment channels, and more.
