Since Vertcoin did not have an ICO (Initial Coin Offering), or pre-mine (allocation of currency at the launch of the network), the development team has to rely on community donations for their funding. Whilst the <strong>developers work as volunteers and do not get paid a salary</strong>, they do make costs to advance the project. On this page, we have detailed a number of donation goals that require additional funds.


You can select the goal that mosts suits you; we pledge to use the funding on the designated goal, and account for these in our <a href="https://medium.com/vertcoin-blog" target="_blank">monthly development update.</a>
