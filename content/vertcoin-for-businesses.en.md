# Make fees your b!tch

There is no fee to receive Vertcoins. And if you’re making payments, you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it’s possible to send 1,000,000 Vertcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 Vertcoin (true story). 


# Forget about fraud

Vertcoin payments are irreversible and secure so as a business you can forget about fraud. 
Also, thanks to extremely low fees, you may easily refund Vertcoins with little impact to your business. 


# A world without borders

Borders are so 1990s! Sending Vertcoin overseas or locally is exactly the same on our network. We believe that borders are so 1990s. We’ve removed the middlemen so there is no waiting, no extra fees for international transfers and no maximum amounts. 

# Accept payments instantly 

As a merchant, we know you’ve jumped through hoops to obtain security checks in order to comply with the PCI standard. The good news is that with Vertcoin you don’t have to worry about that ever again. The even better news is that you do not carry the costs and responsibilities that come with processing sensitive information from your customers like credit card numbers. Vertcoin still requires you to secure your wallet and your payment requests, but you’ll find that you do that already. It’s not rocket science. 


# Over 40 million reasons and counting


Vertopians are loyal and eager to spend their Vertcoins. With over 40 million Vertcoins in circulation Vertcoin is the world’s newest burgeoning market searching for ways to spend their coins. With fractional outlay expenses this is one of the better better decisions you will make. 
Accepting them is a good way to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has often shown to be a clever practice for online businesses.



# Multi-signature

Vertcoin also includes a multi-signature feature which allows Vertcoin to be spent only if a subset of a group of people authorize the transaction. Similar to general consensus, this means that payments can only be validated with enough consent from other members and that ensures valid transactions.


# Accounts so clean 


Vertcoin makes accounting very transparent. As a business or not for profit you may produce accounting documents to outline activity. Achieve the highest level of transparency using Vertcoin. With a few clicks you can provide information that your members can then use to verify your balances and transactions. Non-profit organizations can also allow the public to see how much they receive in donations. To learn more and get you set-up within 48 hours reach out to us by any of the links below.
