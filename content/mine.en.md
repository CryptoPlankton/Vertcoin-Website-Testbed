Mining secures the Vertcoin network and rewards the people securing it with Vertcoin.<br>
[Mining Explained Article](/whatismining)

Because Vertcoin is dedicated to keeping mining accessible to everyone, all you need to get started is an ordinary desktop computer with a modern graphics card (GPU). Highend, newer graphics cards yield better results than lowend or older ones. 

# Simple: One-Click Miner

The Vertcoin One-Click Miner is by far the easiest way to get started. It's a user-friendly piece of software (Windows only), that allows you to start mining with a few easy steps. You can download the One-Click Miner using the button below, and follow <a href="https://medium.com/vertcoin-blog/updated-vertcoin-one-click-miner-ocm-setup-b7052a4664c9" target="_blank">this guide</a> for setting it up.

# Advanced: Dedicated mining hardware

If you're more than a casual miner, you can also consider investing in dedicated mining hardware. You can build a dedicated computer solely for mining, where most so-called _rigs_ contain 6 or more GPUs. By adding a bigger number of GPUs, the rewards are also proportionally higher - but so is the investment upfront.

There are plenty of guides on how to build a dedicated mining rig on the internet; if you're capable of assembling a normal desktop computer, you should be able to assemble a mining rig. Dedicated miners are commonly using a command-line script for starting the miner so that the miner automatically starts when the machine starts. Most dedicated rigs use the mining software <a href="https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer" target="_blank">ccminer</a>, which is also included in the One-Click Miner, but without the Graphical User Interface.
