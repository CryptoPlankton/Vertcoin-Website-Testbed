We’ve been playing the long game for the last four years. A multicoin, multichannel future is around the corner. A future where people will use cryptocurrency to buy groceries and where merchants accept it because of the ridiculously low fees (sorry banks). Vertcoin is driving LITbox’s revolutionary UI. We’re making it accessible to everyday users, merchants and even their parents (that’s right baby boomers we’ve thought of you too)."
